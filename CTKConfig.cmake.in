# build tree may provide either one or multiple build configurations
# depending on the CMake generator used. Since CTK can be used either
# from a build tree or an install tree it is useful for outside
# projects to know the configurations available. If this
# CTKConfig.cmake is in a CTK install tree CTK_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
# will be empty and CTK_BUILD_TYPE will be set to the value of
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE used to build CTK. If CTKConfig.cmake is in a CTK
# build tree then CTK_CONFIGURATION_TYPES and CTK_BUILD_TYPE will have
# values matching CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for
# that build tree (only one will ever be set).
